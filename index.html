    <h1>Peru:A Dream Getaway</h1>
    <h4>A fun place to go.</h4>
    <p>Over the summer I went to Lima, Peru and Cusco, Peru
      with a high elevation of 11,00 feet from sea level
    The cities were beautiful and below I will show you pictures of my
  journey</p>

<p>In Peru, they showed us their culture, popular monuments and resturaunts
in their city. We first traveled to Lima and viewed popular shopping areas and <thead>
  the lovely park. At the lovely park one ca see the "el beso" which can be translated at <thead>
    the kiss. A kissing statue marks the middle of the park.
  </thead>My favorite resturants were called "Popular"and "Mangos."
  After a few days in Lima, we took a plane to Urumbamba, Peru and stayed in the Sacred Valley
  at the Casa Andina hotel. As the days went by, my family and I visited famous churches and viewed different festivals.
  We took a tour with "Condor travels" and saw the Sacsayhuaman landmark. After the tour we took
  a first class train ride to macchu picchu and hiked up difficult trails to see macchu picchu in different angles.
